# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Predicting-Stock-Price-Behaviour
In this study, the impact of social media posts on stock prices of major NASDAQ-listed companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft was investigated. The research analyzed data from Twitter and Reddit to understand the influence of social media sentiment on these companies' stock performance.

A dataset was prepared by collecting news, company names, and stock prices associated with these companies. Data wrangling was performed to clean the dataset for better analysis. Two sentiment analysis models, VADER and FinBERT, were used to analyze the sentiment of social media posts.

The study aimed to identify keywords that had the most significant influence on positive or negative sentiment, as well as to find a correlation between the number of tweets and trade volume. The results were presented using various graphs and plots.

Key findings from the study include:

..> A correlation exists between social media sentiment and stock market performance for major NASDAQ-listed companies.
..> Certain keywords were found to have a strong influence on the sentiment of social media posts, affecting stock prices.
..> There is a relationship between the number of tweets and the trade volume of these companies, suggesting that increased social media activity can impact stock market dynamics.
